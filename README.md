supybot-lastfm (somasonic)
==========================

A plugin for supybot that displays various information about a LastFM ID in IRC. This plugin was mostly developed by kry [https://github.com/krf/supybot-lastfm] and you should look on his repo for more information.

Modifications
------------

I have modified this plugin somewhat to add aliasing to channel nicks of lastfm names, improve the now playing information reply somewhat by adding an extra API call, and I plan to improve the plugin (and fix my own bugs) further over time. This plugin is used on the pepsin irc bot on irc.interlinked.me.
